    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 Avocado</li>
        <li>4 Chicken Sausage Links</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Spinach</li>
        <li>1 Piece of Sourdough Bread</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the sausage:</strong> In a skillet over medium heat, add a splash of oil if needed and cook the chicken sausage links according to package directions until browned and heated through. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Scramble the eggs:</strong> In the same pan, reduce heat to medium-low. Crack in the eggs and stir gently with a spatula. Add the spinach just as the eggs start to set, letting it wilt into the scramble. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Toast the sourdough:</strong> While the eggs cook, toast the sourdough slice to your liking.</li>
        <li><strong>Plate everything:</strong> Arrange the scrambled eggs with spinach, chicken sausage, avocado slices, and sourdough toast on a plate</li>
        <li><strong>Serve warm</strong> with optional chili flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, or hot sauce for extra flavor.</li>
